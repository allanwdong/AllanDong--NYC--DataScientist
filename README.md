"""

I have taken Myers-Briggs several times before and have gotten slightly different variations on the final results. That being said, I consistently score as 'Intuitive' and 'Thinking'. Scoring slightly higher in 'Perceiving' rather than 'Judging' was a surprise - usually I score as 'Judging'. Finally, I recognize in myself a range of traits from both of the traditional Myers-Briggs definitions of 'Extraversion' and 'Introversion'.

In a paragraph, describe the work environment or culture in which you are the most happy, productive and passionate and why. This gives us ideas on how we can best accomodate and welcome you!

Data Science Challenge
We surveyed the existing set of tools and noticed iPython/Jupyter notebooks solved the issue of transparency and reproducibility of results in data science.

You will be asked to complete our Data Science Challenge, driving most of the analysis on Jupyter Notebook, detailing the entire set of transforms, visualizations, write-ups and other supporting processes in your data science pipeline.

Python Programming Challenge
We also require that you take a short Python Programming Challenge which tests your programming skills.

While we are fans of using packages, for the coding test please only use the Python standard library. We want to see your problem solving skills.
